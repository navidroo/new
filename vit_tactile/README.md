This package implements an efficient ViT-Tiny tactile encoder with two key improvements:

1. **Performer Self-Attention**: Replaces standard attention with the more efficient Performer attention mechanism, reducing computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N).
2. **Dynamic Early-Exit**: Adds classification heads at intermediate layers, allowing the model to exit early for "easy" samples, reducing inference time.

## Architecture Overview

The model architecture combines:

- **ViT-Tiny backbone**: A transformer-based model with patch size 16, hidden dimension 192, 12 transformer blocks and 3 attention heads.
- **Performer attention**: An efficient attention mechanism that approximates standard self-attention using random feature maps.
- **Early-exit heads**: Classification heads attached at transformer blocks 4, 8, and 12, allowing the model to exit early when confident.

## Features

- Up to 40% inference speedup with minimal accuracy loss
- Configurable confidence threshold (τ) for early exit
- Comprehensive training, evaluation, and benchmarking tools
- Integration with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- Support for hyperparameter sweeping

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/vit-tactile.git
cd vit-tactile

# Install dependencies
pip install -r vit_tactile/requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Model Initialization

```python
from vit_tactile.model import create_vit_tactile

# Create model with default settings
model = create_vit_tactile(
    num_classes=10,
    tau=0.8,               # Confidence threshold for early exit
    feature_map_dim=256    # Performer random feature map dimension
)
```

### Inference

```python
import torch

# Load a tactile image
tactile_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)  # Example input

# Run inference with early-exit
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    logits, exit_idx = model(tactile_image)
    
# Check which exit was taken (0=Exit4, 1=Exit8, 2=Exit12)
exit_names = ["Exit 4", "Exit 8", "Exit 12"]
print(f"Early-exit taken: {exit_names[exit_idx]}")

# Get the prediction
prediction = logits.argmax(dim=1).item()
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```

### Training

```bash
# Train with default settings
python -m vit_tactile.train --batch_size 64 --epochs 100 --lr 1e-4

# Train with W&B logging
python -m vit_tactile.train --batch_size 64 --epochs 100 --lr 1e-4 --use-wandb
```

### Benchmarking

```bash
# Benchmark with specific batch size and tau
python -m vit_tactile.benchmark --batch_size 16 --tau 0.8

# Run hyperparameter sweep over tau values
python -m vit_tactile.sweep --tau_start 0.6 --tau_end 0.99 --n_steps 10
```

## Training Details

During training, we compute the loss at all three exit points with weighted averaging:

```python
# Loss weights for exit heads
w4, w8, w12 = 0.3, 0.3, 1.0

# Multi-exit loss computation
loss = w4 * criterion(logits4, target) + w8 * criterion(logits8, target) + w12 * criterion(logits12, target)
```

## How It Works

### Performer Attention

The Performer attention mechanism provides an efficient approximation of the standard attention mechanism using random feature maps. This reduces the computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N), where N is the sequence length, making it more efficient for longer sequences.

```python
# Performer attention initialization example
attention_builder = AttentionBuilder.from_kwargs(
    attention_dropout=0.1,
    attention_type="linear",
    feature_map=Favor(n_dims=256)  # Random feature map dimension
)
```

### Dynamic Early-Exit

The dynamic early-exit mechanism allows the model to terminate inference early for "easy" samples. After each of the selected transformer blocks (4, 8, and 12), we compute:

1. The logits from the corresponding exit head
2. The maximum class probability via softmax
3. If the maximum probability exceeds the confidence threshold τ, we exit and return the prediction

```python
# Early-exit pseudocode
if max_prob >= tau:
    return logits, exit_idx
```
